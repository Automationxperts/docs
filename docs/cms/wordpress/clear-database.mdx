## Delete Media Files Data

Sometime you want to delete only the database records

Each file in your media library has one row in the `wp_posts` table and two rows in the `wp_postmeta` table.

```sql
DELETE FROM `wp_posts` WHERE `post_type` = "attachment";
```

```sql
DELETE FROM `wp_postmeta` WHERE `meta_key` = "_wp_attached_file";
```

```sql
DELETE FROM `wp_postmeta` WHERE `meta_key` = "_wp_attachment_metadata";
```

## Delete MainWP Records

```sql
DELETE FROM `wp_options` where option_name like '%mainwp_%'
```
