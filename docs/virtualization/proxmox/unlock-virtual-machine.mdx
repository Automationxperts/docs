# How to Unlock a Virtual Machine in Proxmox

## Method 1: Using qm command

1. Log in to Proxmox host using SSH.

2. Identify the VM ID of the VM that needs to be unlocked. You can list all VMs by running `qm list`.

3. Unlock the VM by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    qm unlock {VM-ID}
    ```

4. Verify that the VM is unlocked by running the command `qm list`.

## Method 2: Using Web Interface

1. Log in to the Proxmox web interface.

2. Navigate to the page for the VM that needs to be unlocked.

3. Click on the <b>"Unlock"</b> button.

4. Verify that the VM is unlocked by navigating to the same page. The <b>"Unlock"</b> button should be replaced by <b>"Lock"</b> button.

## Method 3: Manually deleting the lock

1. Log in to Proxmox host using SSH.

2. Identify the VM ID of the VM that needs to be unlocked.

3. Navigate to the directory `/var/lock/qemu-server/`.

4. Delete the lock file corresponding to the VM ID. The file will have the same name as the VM ID.

5. Verify that the VM is unlocked by running the command `qm list`.
