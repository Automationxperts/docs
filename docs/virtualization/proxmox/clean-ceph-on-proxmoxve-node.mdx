To clean Ceph from a ProxmoxVE node, follow these steps:

1. Stop all remaining Ceph services:

```bash
systemctl stop ceph-mon.target
systemctl stop ceph-mgr.target
systemctl stop ceph-mds.target
systemctl stop ceph-osd.target
```

2. Avoid Ceph services being restarted by systemd the next boot by removing the following files:

```bash
rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/ceph*
```

2. Be sure that Ceph services are stopped by running the following command:

```bash
killall -9 ceph-mon ceph-mgr ceph-mds
```

3. Remove the following directories:

```bash
rm -rf /var/lib/ceph/mon/
rm -rf /var/lib/ceph/mgr/
rm -rf /var/lib/ceph/mds/
```

3. Retry the Ceph purge:

```bash
pveceph purge
```

5. Finally, uninstall Ceph:

```bash
apt purge ceph-mon ceph-osd ceph-mgr ceph-mds
```

This completes the process of cleaning Ceph from a ProxmoxVE node.
