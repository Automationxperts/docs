### Separate a Node Without Reinstalling

First, stop the corosync and pve-cluster services on the node:

```bash
systemctl stop pve-cluster
systemctl stop corosync
```

Start the cluster file system again in local mode:

```bash
pmxcfs -l
```
Delete the corosync configuration files:

```bash
rm /etc/pve/corosync.conf
rm -r /etc/corosync/*
```
You can now start the file system again as a normal service:

```bash
killall pmxcfs
systemctl start pve-cluster
```

The node is now separated from the cluster. You can delete it from any remaining node of the cluster with:

```bash
pvecm delnode oldnode
```

And then repeat the `pvecm delnode` command.

Now switch back to the separated node and delete all the remaining cluster files on it. This ensures that the node can be added to another cluster again without problems.

```bash
rm /var/lib/corosync/*
```
As the configuration files from the other nodes are still in the cluster file system, you may want to clean those up too. After making absolutely sure that you have the correct node name, you can simply remove the entire directory recursively from `/etc/pve/nodes/NODENAME`.

```bash
rm -r /etc/pve/nodes/NODENAME
```
:::caution

The nodeâ€™s SSH keys will remain in the authorized_key file. This means that the nodes can still connect to each other with public key authentication. You should fix this by removing the respective keys from the /etc/pve/priv/authorized_keys file.

```bash
ssh-keygen -R oldnodeip
```

:::

ðŸŽ‰ Now you can add the node to another cluster again.
