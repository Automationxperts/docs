# Forgotten Password with a Locked Console

If the console is password protected, all is not lost. It takes two reboots to accomplish, but the password can be reset with physical access to the console:

1. Connect to the console
2. Reboot the firewall
3. Choose the Boot Single User option `(2)` from the loader menu with the ASCII logo
3. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> when prompted to start `/bin/sh`
4. Remount all partitions as rewritable:
    - The specific commands vary based on the filesystem.
    - For devices installed using UFS, see [Re-mount UFS Volumes as Read/Write][pfsense-docs-single-user-mode-ufs].
    - For devices installed using ZFS, see [Re-mount ZFS Volumes as Read/Write][pfsense-docs-single-user-mode-zfs].

5. Run the built-in password reset command:
    ```sh
    /etc/rc.initial.password
    ```

6. Follow the prompts to reset the password
7. Run `/sbin/reboot` to reboot.

When the firewall reboots, login with the [Default Username and Password][pfsense-docs-default-creds].
