# How to Set Up a Docker Proxy Using tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy

## Introduction

When running Docker in production, you typically don't want to expose the Docker daemon socket to external networks. This poses a challenge for tools and apps that need access to the Docker API.

One solution is to set up a proxy that controls and secures access to the Docker API. In this guide, we'll use the open source [tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy) project to set up a proxy for the Docker socket.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you'll need:

- Docker installed and running on the host machine
- Docker Compose installed

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Docker and Docker Compose. If not quick refresh your knowledge with [docker basics](./docker-basics.mdx)

## Step 1 - Create Compose File

First, we'll create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run the proxy:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  proxy:
    image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy
    volumes:
      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro'
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=info # debug,info,notice,warning,err,crit,alert,emerg
      - CONTAINERS: 1
      - SERVICES: 1
      - IAMGES: 1
      - INF0: 1
      - NETWORKS: 1
      - TASKS: 1
      - NODES: 0
```

This runs the `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy` image and mounts the host Docker socket into the container.

:::info

The `environment` section specifies access controls - we've allowed access to containers, services, iamges, info, tasks and networks API endpoints. **(0 = no access, 1 = access) **

:::


See the tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy [README](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy/blob/master/README.md) for full options.

## Step 2 - Run the Proxy

Run the proxy with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The proxy is now running in the background, proxying requests to the Docker socket!

## Step 3 - Test the Proxy

We can test it by accessing the proxy API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:2375/version
```

This should return the Docker version, confirming the proxy is working correctly.

## Step 4 - Secure the Proxy

For production deployments, you'll want to add authentication and SSL encryption to secure the proxy.

The tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy project supports this via environment variables. See the project [README](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy/blob/master/README.md) for details on:

- Basic auth

## Wrap Up

That's it! With a few simple steps we have a Docker socket proxy set up to securely manage API access.

The docker-socket-proxy container provides secure access to the Docker API from outside the host. This is useful for tools that need access to remotely control Docker, like CI/CD pipelines. The proxy container method is more secure than opening the port directly.

Let me know in the comments if you have any other tips for accessing Docker remotely!
