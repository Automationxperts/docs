Are you trying to set up Cloudflared on your mips64 OS router, such as the UniFi Edge Router?

Unfortunately, Currently Cloudflare does not provide a binary for mips64 architecture. However, you can still build and install the Cloudflared agent from source. This guide will walk you through the steps to build and install Cloudflared on your mips64 router. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.20 or later
- [Git](../version-control/git/basic.mdx) (optional, if you want to clone the repository)
- SSH access to your router
- Cloudflare account with a zone configured
- Token from [Cloudflare Tunnel page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/remote/#1-create-a-tunnel)

## Steps

:::info

Replace `[router_username]`, `[router_ip]`, and `[token-from-cloudflare]` with your actual values.

:::

1. Clone the Cloudflared repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared.git
   ```

2. Change to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd cloudflared
   ```

3. Build the binary for mips64 architecture:

   ```bash
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=mips64 go build github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/cmd/cloudflared
   ```

   This will create a binary named `cloudflared` in the current directory.

4. Copy the binary to your router:

   ```bash
   scp cloudflared [router_username]@[router_ip]:/tmp/
   ```

5. SSH into your router:

   ```bash
   ssh [router_username]@[router_ip]
   ```

6. Change to the `/tmp` directory:

   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   ```

7. Change the owner of the binary to root:

   ```bash
   sudo chown root:root cloudflared
   ```

8. Make the binary executable:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x cloudflared
   ```

9. Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv cloudflared /usr/bin/
   ```

10. Create the cloudflared config directory:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /etc/cloudflared
    ```

11. Create the cloudflared config file:

    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
    ```

12. Add the following content to `config.yml` file:

    ```yaml title="config.yml"
    proxy-dns: true
    proxy-dns-upstream:
      - https://1.1.1.1/dns-query
      - https://1.0.0.1/dns-query
    proxy-dns-port: 8853
    ```

13. Start the cloudflared service:

    ```bash
    sudo /usr/bin/cloudflared service install [token-from-cloudflare]
    ```

That's it! You have successfully installed Cloudflared on your mips64 router. You can now configure your router to use Cloudflare DNS.

:::info

Please note that after every firmware upgrade on your router, you will need to re-install Cloudflared on your router as the firmware upgrade will remove the binary from your router.
