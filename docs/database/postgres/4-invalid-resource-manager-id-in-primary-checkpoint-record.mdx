:::warning

Be aware there may be data loss if you follow the steps below and your system is heavily corrupted.  Please make sure you have a backup of your data before proceeding.

:::

1. Get access to Container shell using following command:
    
    ```bash
     kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/sh
    ```
    In docker container, you can use following command:
    
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/sh
    ```

    If you cannot get access to container shell, because of the crashloop, make following changes in the deployment manifest and apply it again.

    ```yaml 
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: postgres
        image: postgres:13.2
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do sleep 30; done;"]
    ```
2. Run following command to reset WAL log files:

    You will need be run following commands as postgres user.

    ```bash
    su - postgres
    ```

    ```bash
    # dry run 
    pg_resetwal --dry-run /var/lib/postgresql/data
    ```
    
    ```bash
    pg_resetwal -f /var/lib/postgresql/data
    ```

3. Restart the PostgreSQL container and remove the command and args from the deployment manifest if you have made any changes in the previous step.
