### Create a new database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
```

### Rename a database

```sql
ALTER DATABASE <database_name> RENAME TO <new_database_name>;
```

### Listing databases

A single Postgres server process can manage multiple databases at the same time. You can view all of the defined databases on the server by using the `\list` meta-command or its shortcut `\l`.

```sql
\l
```

### Switch to a specific database

To swtich to different database in postgresql, use the `\connect` meta-command or its shortcut `\c`.

```sql
\c <database>
```

### Listing tables

To list all tables in your current database, use the `\dt` meta-command.

```sql
\dt
```

### Listing all users

Use `\du` to list all users accounts (or roles) in the connected PostgresSQL server.

```sql
\du
```

To get more information in all users, use `\du+`.

```sql
\du+
```

#### Listing users using SQL Statement

```sql
SELECT usename AS role_name,
  CASE
     WHEN usesuper AND usecreatedb THEN
	   CAST('superuser, create database' AS pg_catalog.text)
     WHEN usesuper THEN
	    CAST('superuser' AS pg_catalog.text)
     WHEN usecreatedb THEN
	    CAST('create database' AS pg_catalog.text)
     ELSE
	    CAST('' AS pg_catalog.text)
  END role_attributes
FROM pg_catalog.pg_user
ORDER BY role_name desc;
```

### Creating user

```sql
CREATE USER <username> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD <password>;
```

### Giving all permission to a user on a specific database

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <user_name>;
```

### Changing the owner of the PostgresSQL Database

```sql
ALTER DATABASE <database> OWNER TO <username>;
```

### Checking active connections to postgresql server

```sql
select pid as process_id, 
       usename as username, 
       datname as database_name, 
       client_addr as client_address, 
       application_name,
       backend_start,
       state,
       state_change
from pg_stat_activity;
```
