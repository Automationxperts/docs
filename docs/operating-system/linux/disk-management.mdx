### Check Partations

```bash 
sudo lsblk
```

Output 

```bash
Output
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0     7:0    0 91.1M  1 loop /snap/core/6531
loop1     7:1    0 56.7M  1 loop /snap/google-cloud-sdk/75
sda       8:0    0   10G  0 disk 
â”œâ”€sda1    8:1    0  9.9G  0 part /
â”œâ”€sda14   8:14   0    4M  0 part 
â””â”€sda15   8:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
sdb       8:16   0   10G  0 disk 
```

### Format the disk (ext4)

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -F -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard /dev/DEVICE_ID
```

### Mount the new disk

Create a new directory

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /folder/directory
```

Mount disk to the directory

```bash
sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/sdb /folder/directory
```

Set read write permission
```bash
sudo chmod a+w /folder/directory
```

### Set up auto mount on Restart

Creating backup of current fstab (failsafe ðŸ˜‰)

```bash
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup
```

Get the UUID of the disk

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/DEVICE_ID
```
Create an entry in /etc/fstab to mount the /dev/sdb persistent disk at /folder/directory using its UUID.

```bash
echo UUID=`sudo blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sdb` /folder/directory ext4 discard,defaults,nofail 0 2 | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

**Note: Replace dev/sdb if your disk id is different**

## Verify entry

```bash
cat /etc/fstab
```



## Unmounting a File System 

This section doc is from (Reference: [Linuxize](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-and-unmount-file-systems-in-linux/#unmounting-a-file-system))

To detach a mounted file system, use the umount command followed by either the directory where it has been mounted (mount point) or the device name:

```bash
umount DIRECTORY
```

```bash
umount DEVICE_NAME
```


If the file system is in use the umount command will fail to detach the file system. In those situations, you can use the fuser command to find out which processes are accessing the file system:

```bash
fuser -m DIRECTORY
```


Once you determine the processes you can stop them and unmount the file system.
Lazy unmount

Use the `-l (--lazy)` option to unmount a busy file system as soon as it is not busy anymore.

```bash
umount -l DIRECTORY
```


Force unmount

Use the `-f (--force)` option to force an unmount. This option is usually used to unmount an unreachable NFS system.

```bash
umount -f DIRECTORY
```


Generally not a good idea to force unmount as it may corrupt the data on the file system.
